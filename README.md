# AI Avatar App

## Overview
The AI Avatar App is a prototype application for creating customizable AI avatars that can act out user-uploaded scripts. It is designed for use in content creation and corporate videos. This project includes:

- **Avatar Customization**: Modify the appearance and behavior of avatars.
- **Script Upload**: Allow users to upload scripts for avatar performances.
- **Text-to-Speech Integration**: Convert scripts into speech with realistic lip-syncing.
- **Video Rendering**: Export animated avatars as video files.

## Features
- **Customizable Avatars**:
  - Adjust facial features, hairstyles, clothing, and more.
- **Script-to-Speech**:
  - Converts text scripts to speech using AI-driven Text-to-Speech (TTS) APIs.
- **Lip-Sync and Animation**:
  - Synchronize avatar movements and speech.
- **Video Export**:
  - Export high-quality videos for use in content creation.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Firebase
- **Text-to-Speech**: Google Cloud TTS (or AWS Polly as an alternative)
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js or Unity (for advanced avatar animations)
- **Video Processing**: FFmpeg.js
